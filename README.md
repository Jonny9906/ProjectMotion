# About This Project
This project utilizes AI and 3-D simulations to dramatically improve mechanics of baseball batters and pitchers. It uses computer vision, the latest technology in AI, in order to generate accurate 3-D simulations of actual batter position, for and execution for evaluation and feedback.
